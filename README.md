# Bowling Display
I am attempting to make a bowling display similar to this one, only its built in HTML, CSS, JS, and will hopefully have a CSS editor and allow you to upload your own animations!

scope creep is definetly creeping and I am finding it harder and harder to continue working on this project, I may continue working on it in the future but it is not certain that it will be finished.
